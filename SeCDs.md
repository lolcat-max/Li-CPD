Selenium-doped carbonized polymer dots (SeCDs) are a class of multifunctional nanomaterials synthesized typically by hydrothermal or solvothermal methods that incorporate selenium atoms into the carbon dot structure. These selenium-doped carbon dots exhibit several bioactive properties including:

- Strong antioxidant capability by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions, which helps in reducing oxidative stress.[1][2]
- Inhibition of Î²-amyloid aggregation, making them promising candidates for multi-target therapy in Alzheimer's disease by disrupting amyloid plaques and reducing neurotoxicity.[3][1]
- Metal ion chelation, particularly copper ions, which decreases toxic metal-induced oxidative damage in neural tissues.[1]
- Enhanced cellular uptake and biocompatibility, supporting their use in bioimaging and therapeutic delivery.[4][5]
- Mimicry of glutathione peroxidase activity through Se-S bonds, promoting redox balance, cell proliferation, and apoptosis regulation, which could help in tissue repair and aging cell revitalization.[6]
- Potential broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects due to their multifunctionality and reactive chemical groups.[7]

Selenium doping enhances the photoluminescent properties of carbon dots, producing bright and stable fluorescence useful for imaging and real-time monitoring. SeCDs also exhibit dose-dependent cytoprotective effects and selective toxicity toward cancer cells, indicating their potential in oncology.

Overall, selenium-doped carbonized polymer dots integrate antioxidant, anti-amyloid, metal-chelating, and enzyme-mimicking activities, making them powerful nanoplatforms for neurological therapy, bioimaging, and biomedical applications.[2][3][6][1]

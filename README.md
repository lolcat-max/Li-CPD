Here is a step-by-step ingredient-based protocol to produce lithium-doped carbonized polymer dots (Li-CPDs) without an autoclave:

Ingredients
Polymer precursor: Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), citric acid, or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) commonly used

Lithium salt: lithium chloride (LiCl), lithium acetate, or lithium perchlorate (LiClO4)

Solvent: Deionized water, ethanol, or a mixture

Optional cross-linking agents or additives depending on polymer precursor

Step-by-step synthesis
Preparation of the precursor solution:

Dissolve 1-2 g of polymer precursor (e.g., PVA or citric acid) in 50 mL deionized water or ethanol with stirring.

Add lithium salt (e.g., LiCl) in a molar ratio suitable for doping, typically 5-10% mol relative to polymer carbon content.

Stir until fully dissolved.

Heating and carbonization:

Transfer the solution to an open or sealed glass or Teflon reactor.

Heat under airflow or mild oxygen flow using a heating mantle or oil bath at around 200°C.

Maintain temperature for 4-6 hours to promote polymerization, carbonization, and lithium incorporation.

Cooling and collection:

Cool the reaction vessel to room temperature naturally.

The mixture will contain carbonized polymer dots doped with lithium ions.

Purification:

Filter the mixture to remove larger particulates using a less than 0.22 μm filter.

Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes to collect the dispersed Li-CPDs.

Dialyze using a membrane with molecular weight cutoff around 1-3 kDa in water for 24 hours to remove unreacted salts and small molecules.

Drying and storage:

Dry the purified Li-CPDs by vacuum drying or freeze-drying.

Store the dry powder or concentrated solution for further use.
